# Email-Security-Analysis

## Objective:
The objective of the Phishing Email and Attacks for Email Links & Attacks for Email Headers project is to develop an efficient system for analyzing and mitigating phishing attacks targeting email users. The primary goal is to investigate suspicious emails, scrutinize their links and headers, and assess their authenticity to detect and prevent phishing attempts effectively. This project aims to enhance the organization's email security posture and empower users to recognize and respond to phishing threats appropriately.

### Skills Learned:

- Identification and analysis of phishing emails and their characteristics.
- Examination and validation of email links to determine their legitimacy.
- Interpretation of email headers to detect anomalies and potential signs of spoofing.
- Utilization of threat intelligence platforms and tools for phishing email analysis.
- Enhancement of email security awareness and incident response capabilities.

### Tools Used:

- Email analysis platforms such as MXToolbox and CheckPhish for scrutinizing email characteristics.
- Hybrid analysis services like VirusTotal and URLScan.io for assessing the safety of email links.
- Reputation checking tools to evaluate the reputation of sender IP addresses.
- Email header analyzers for inspecting email headers and detecting anomalies.
- Phishing simulation tools for training users to recognize and report phishing emails.

## Steps:

1. Email Analysis Setup: Configure email analysis platforms and tools for scrutinizing phishing emails, links, and headers.
2. Phishing Email Examination: Investigate suspicious emails received by users, focusing on identifying common phishing indicators.
3. Link Verification: Validate links embedded within the email content using hybrid analysis services to check for malicious activity.
4. Email Header Inspection: Analyze email headers to detect signs of spoofing or manipulation, examining sender details and routing information.
5. Threat Assessment: Assess the severity and potential impact of identified phishing emails, determining the appropriate response and mitigation strategies.

This project aims to enhance the organization's resilience against phishing attacks by equipping users with the knowledge and tools necessary to identify and respond to phishing threats effectively.
